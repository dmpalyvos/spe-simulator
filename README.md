# Simulations For Stream Processing

This project is a simple simultion toolkit for testing scheduling strategies in multithreaded Stream Processing Engines (SPEs).]

There is support for custom Operators, Sources, Queries, Schedulers and Threads. Since no actual computation takes place, the simulations are usually executed very quickly.

No support for intra-operator paralleism (multiple threads per operator) exists at the moment.
